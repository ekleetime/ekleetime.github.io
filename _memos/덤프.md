I wouldn't do it with TOAD, but from command prompt, using Data Pump Export and Import on command prompt. Here's an example.

First, as SYS, create a directory (Oracle object) which points to directory (folder) on my hard disk drive. Grant required privileges on it to user which will be using it.

SQL> show user
USER is "SYS"
SQL> create directory my_dir as 'c:\temp';

Directory created.

SQL> grant read, write on directory my_dir to mdp;

Grant succeeded.
As MDP (it is user I created while answering your other question, here: What are roles and privileges to give a user in order to perform CRUD(on Oracle 12)), create some objects:

SQL> connect mdp/pdm@xe
Connected.
SQL> create table test (id number);

Table created.

SQL> create view v_test as select * From test;

View created.

SQL> insert into test
  2    select level from dual
  3    connect by level <= 5;

5 rows created.

SQL> commit;

Commit complete.
OK, operating system level, command prompt: export the user:

C:\>expdp mdp/pdm@xe directory=my_dir file=mdp.dmp log=mdp_exp.log

Nice; exported successfully.

Now, using SYS Oracle user, I'll drop MDP user; CASCADE is used because user has some objects which have to be dropped too. Why am I dropping it? To simulate your case, i.e. moving the DMP file to another computer/database which doesn't contain that user.

C:\>sqlplus sys@xe as sysdba

SQL> drop user mdp cascade;

User dropped.

SQL>
Pretend we're now on another computer; first, I'm going to create the MDP user:

SQL> show user
USER is "SYS"
SQL> create user mdp identified by test
  2  default tablespace users
  3  temporary tablespace temp
  4  quota unlimited on users;

User created.

SQL> grant create session to mdp;

Grant succeeded.

Back to operating system command prompt as I'm now going to import DMP file's contents.

C:\>impdp system@xe directory=my_dir dumpfile=mdp.dmp logfile=mdp_imp.log

Don't forget what I said in another topic: grant MPD only privileges it needs. Currently, it can only create session and use existing objects, but can't create anything.

That's how it goes, more or less. Don't rely too much on GUI (you know how it is; those who live by the GUI, die by the GUI), clicking here and clicking there, hoping that something good will happen. Most probably won't. Though, once you know what you're doing, GUI is really a great help.
